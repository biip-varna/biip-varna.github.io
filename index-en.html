    <h1>Welcome to the Bulgarian Institute for International Politics</h1>
    <p>We are an independent, non-profit association based in Varna, Bulgaria.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to support inclusive, critical, and civic-minded reflection on politics â€” in Bulgaria, Europe, and beyond.</p>
    <p>Through commentary, analysis, and multilingual publishing, we provide a platform for early-career voices, underrepresented thinkers, and established experts to engage in meaningful political dialogue.</p>
    <p>BIIP operates voluntarily, without commercial interests or external funding. We believe that thoughtful ideas deserve space!</p>
