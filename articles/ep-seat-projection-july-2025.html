    <h1>European Parliament seat projection (July 2025): Could the “von der Leyen coalition” lose its majority?</h1>
    <p><em>04 July 2025 — By Manuel Müller</em></p>

  <p>The mood within the von der Leyen coalition in the European Parliament has become
    <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/greenwashing-law-brussels-european-commission-political-explosion-anti-green-push/">very tense recently</a>.
    The centrist alliance of the European People’s Party (EPP), the Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) and the Liberals (RE),
    which <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/20/european-parliaments-centrist-groups-cut-deal-to-approve-new-commissioners">paved the way to the election of the European Commission</a> in autumn 2024, has never functioned particularly well.</p>

  <p>The three groups reached a basic coalition agreement known as the
    <a href="https://www.socialistsanddemocrats.eu/sites/default/files/2024-11/platform-cooperation-statement-between-epp-sd-and-renew-europe-en-241120.pdf">“Platform Cooperation Statement”</a>.
    In practice, however, the EPP has <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/epp-allies-with-far-right-to-investigate-occult-ngo-funding/">increasingly been using</a>
    the alternative <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/far-right-venezuela-european-parliament-power-imbalance-epp-legislature/">“Venezuela majority”</a>,
    i.e. an alliance with the three far-right groups ECR, PfE and ESN.</p>

  <h2>An ultimatum of sorts</h2>
  <p>Recently, even the EPP-led Commission
    <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-to-kill-eu-anti-greenwashing-rules/">moved towards the demands of the far right</a>
    on some environmental policy issues. In response, both the
    <a href="https://table.media/en/europe/news/von-der-leyen-coalition-socialists-give-commission-president-an-ultimatum">S&amp;D</a> and
    <a href="https://table.media/en/europe/news/renew-von-der-leyen-to-send-signal-for-progressive-agenda-at-soteu">RE</a>
    publicly stated their disagreement and gave von der Leyen an ultimatum of sorts. By the
    <a href="https://state-of-the-union.ec.europa.eu/index_en">State of the Union address</a> in September at the latest, she must send a clear signal that the EPP and the Commission continue to support the agenda of the pro-European centre.</p>

  <p>Should this signal fail to materialise, however, the S&amp;D and RE will have few options for action. A vote of no confidence in the Commission requires a two-thirds majority, meaning that the S&amp;D and RE would themselves need to join forces with the far-right groups (who, in fact, have
    <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-will-survive-no-confidence-vote-but-not-painless-pfizer-pandemic/">just tabled such a vote for next week</a>).
    And even if this were to happen, the next Commission President would still be proposed by the European Council, where the EPP is the largest group.</p>

  <p>An end to the pro-European alliance in the European Parliament would therefore only lead to a permanent deadlock – so we can safely assume that the EPP, S&amp;D and RE will find a way to work together again.</p>

  <h2>Weakened von der Leyen alliance</h2>
  <p>Amidst all the coalition wrangling, one thing that is always taken for granted is that the three centrist groups together have a majority in Parliament. Until the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_European_Parliament_election">2019 European election</a>, the EPP and S&amp;D had always been able to form a majority together; since then, they have needed the Liberals as a third partner.
    This expanded grand coalition <a href="https://fiia.fi/en/publication/the-rise-of-the-far-right-in-the-european-union">held firm</a> in the 2024 European election.</p>

  <p>So far, the success of the von der Leyen coalition has depended solely on the political will of its member parties, rather than on their seat numbers in the Parliament.</p>

  <p>But for how much longer? In the seat projection, the values of the far-right bloc have risen almost continuously in recent months. The ECR, PfE and ESN climbed from a combined total of 187 seats in the June 2024 election to 196 seats in October, 200 seats in December, 211 seats in March, and 214 seats in May. In contrast, the figures for the von der Leyen coalition have continued to fall.</p>

  <p>While the EPP, S&amp;D and RE had a total of 401 seats at the European election, this figure fell to 396 in January and then to 385 in May.</p>

  <h2>No reliable majority</h2>
  <p>In the current seat projection, the far-right bloc continues to rise, reaching 215 seats, while the centrist alliance loses ground once again. With 378 seats in the base projection, it reaches an all-time low, representing only just over half of the 720 seats in the Parliament. Taking into account that group cohesion is weaker than in national parliaments, the von der Leyen coalition would no longer have a reliable majority (unlike the “Venezuela” alliance, which stands at 396 seats).</p>

  <p>A lot still needs to happen before the pro-European center in Parliament really becomes a minority. Firstly, it is likely that the EPP, S&amp;D and RE will include new parties after the next European election that are not currently represented in Parliament. In the dynamic seat projection scenario, which takes this into account, the three groups together still hold 382 seats.</p>

  <h2>With the Greens – or the ECR?</h2>
  <p>Secondly, there are the Greens, who also belong to the pro-European centre and are generally willing to cooperate with the von der Leyen coalition. In fact, the Greens/EFA group is the biggest winner in the current projection, achieving one of their best results in this election period after a long dry spell. The EPP, S&amp;D, RE and Greens/EFA currently have a combined total of 422 seats in the base scenario of the projection – not an overwhelming majority, but still a comfortable one.</p>

  <p>However, the EPP would probably push for
    <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/my-majority-is-becoming-reality-epp-leader-weber-proclaims/">closer cooperation between the three centrist parties and the ECR instead</a>.
    From the perspective of the current EPP leader Manfred Weber, at least, the ECR can apparently
    <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/interview-epp-chief-manfred-weber-on-defence-the-green-deal-and-his-future-ambitions/">also be considered “pro-European”</a> – even though this view is
    <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-epp-german-leader-manfred-weber-lawmakers-european-union-delegation/">not supported by other EPP members</a>,
    particularly the Polish PO.</p>

  <p>Of course, the 2029 European elections are still a long way off. If recent trends continue, however, the “eternal grand coalition” could then be faced with the question of which direction it wants to expand in: whether it prefers to bring the ECR or the Greens on board as regular cooperation partners. This is unlikely to make the conflicts that already exist between the EPP, S&amp;D and RE today any easier to resolve.</p>

  <h2>EPP: mixed balance</h2>
  <p>Taking a detailed look at the polling results of the last two months, the picture for the EPP is mixed. It has strengthened its position as the strongest national force in Germany, Spain and Estonia, and the Hungarian EPP member party Tisza’s lead over Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz (PfE) continues to grow.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Polish governing party PO, led by Donald Tusk, is falling behind in the polls following the
    <a href="https://www.foederalist.eu/2025/06/poland-nawrocki-presidency.html">debacle in the national presidential election in June</a>.
    Meanwhile, the smaller Polish EPP member, PSL, would no longer be represented in the European Parliament at all following the
    <a href="https://notesfrompoland.com/2025/06/18/polands-third-way-alliance-confirms-split-but-remains-within-tusks-ruling-coalition/">end of its electoral alliance with the centrist PL2050 (RE)</a>.
    Overall, therefore, the EPP only made slight gains, standing at 181 seats (+2 compared to May).</p>

  <h2>S&amp;D: new all-time low</h2>
  <p>The centre-left S&amp;D group has been the biggest loser in recent weeks. In Spain, the PSOE has been
    <a href="https://english.elpais.com/spain/2025-06-13/spains-pedro-sanchez-scrambles-to-hold-government-coalition-together-after-top-aide-is-implicated-in-corruption-scandal.html">rocked by a corruption scandal</a> and is falling behind. In Portugal, the PS continues to lose ground in the first polls since its defeat in the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Portuguese_legislative_election">national parliamentary elections in May</a>.
    In Romania, the PSD has also slipped further following the
    <a href="https://www.romania-insider.com/ciolacu-resigns-may-2025">resignation of party leader and Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu in May</a>.</p>

  <p>In Hungary, the DK, which has lost many of its voters to Tisza and has also experienced the
    <a href="https://telex.hu/english/2025/05/08/ferenc-gyurcsany-resigns-from-all-posts-and-withdraws-from-public-life">departure of its long-standing party leader, Ferenc Gyurcsány</a>,
    would now no longer be represented in the European Parliament. In total, the S&amp;D falls back to 124 seats (–6) in the projection – a new historic low.</p>

  <h2>RE: further losses</h2>
  <p>The liberal-centrist RE group also suffers further losses in the projection. In Poland, the split from the PSL (EPP) means that PL2050 would now also fail to reach the national 5% threshold. In the Netherlands, the VVD is
    <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2025/06/14/vvd-leader-yesilgoz-wants-right-liberal-government">seeking a new direction</a> following the
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/03/netherlands-government-collapse-geert-wilders">collapse of the governing coalition with the far-right PVV (PfE)</a>,
    and ahead of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Dutch_general_election">snap national parliamentary elections in November</a>.
    In Bulgaria, the APS <a href="https://www.novinite.com/articles/231861/DPS-Dogan+Withdraws+Support%3A+Bulgarian+Government+Loses+Formal+Majority!+What+Now">left the national governing coalition</a> in April and would currently no longer win a seat in the European Parliament.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Liberals made slight gains in Romania (where their supported candidate, Nicușor Dan, won the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Romanian_presidential_election">national presidential election in May</a>),
    as well as in France and Portugal. Nevertheless, the RE falls to 73 seats (–3) in the projection, one of its weakest figures in ten years.</p>

  <h2>Greens and Left on the rise</h2>
  <p>Meanwhile, as previously mentioned, the Greens are making gains. In the Czech Republic, the G/EFA member party Piráti is benefiting from an
    <a href="https://www.zeleni.cz/demokracie-potrebuje-spojence-pirati-a-zeleni-uzaviraji-memorandum-o-spolupraci-do-voleb/">electoral alliance recently agreed with the small Green party Zelení (EGP)</a>.
    In Portugal, the animal rights party PAN would now be represented in the European Parliament for the first time in a long time. The Greens are also making slight gains in Germany and Croatia, albeit only due to minimal fluctuations in the polls. Overall, the group has now 44 seats (+4) in the projection.</p>

  <p>The Left group also saw modest increases. Due in particular to slightly improved figures for LFI in France, the Left now stands at 51 seats (+2).</p>

  <h2>ESN grows for the sixth time in a row</h2>
  <p>For far-right groups, the projection shows few changes. The ECR has gained ground in Poland and Romania, strengthening its position as the dominant national force in both countries. In Denmark, however, it has fallen back slightly due to small fluctuations in the polls. Overall, this brings the ECR to 80 seats (+1), its highest figure in this electoral term to date.</p>

  <p>The PfE group made gains in Poland, where the far-right Konfederacja party saw significant growth following the national presidential election. The Belgian VB, on the other hand, fell back slightly, as did the PfE member parties from France and the Czech Republic, again due to minor poll fluctuations. Overall, the PfE therefore recorded a slight loss (99 seats/–1).</p>

  <p>Within the small ESN group, the German AfD lost support but this was more than offset by the strong gains made by the Polish Konfederacja. Overall, the ESN climbed to 36 seats (+1). This is the sixth time in a row that it has gained seats in the seat projection, bringing it to almost one and a half times its level in the 2024 European election.</p>

  <h2>Non-attached and “other” parties</h2>
  <p>Among the non-attached parties, the German left-wing conservative BSW recorded slight losses. Additionally, the Czech left-wing populist Stačilo alliance and the Greek right-wing NIKI party would now both fail to meet the national thresholds. As a result, the non-attached parties together hold only 20 seats now (–3).</p>

  <p>By contrast, the “other” parties (which are not currently represented in the European Parliament and do not belong to any European party, meaning that they cannot be clearly assigned to any political group) increase to 12 seats in the projection (+3). Some parties that had not appeared in the table for some time have now returned:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Following the <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2025/06/20/former-pvv-state-sec-ingrid-coenradie-joins-right-wing-party-ja21">addition of former State Secretary Ingrid Coenradie (previously PVV/PfE)</a>, the Dutch right-wing party JA21 has made gains in the national polls and would now win back a seat. JA21 previously belonged to the ECR group and could rejoin it.</li>
    <li>In Greece, the left-wing party MéRA25 would once again just surpass the national three-percent threshold.</li>
    <li>The Bulgarian far-right party MECh would now also narrowly win a seat in the Parliament again. Given its Russia-friendly stance, the party is most likely to join the PfE or ESN group.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The overview</h2>
  <p>The following table breaks down the projected distribution of seats by individual national parties. The table follows the baseline scenario, in which each national party is attributed to its current parliamentary group (or to the parliamentary group of its European political party) and parties without a clear attribution are labelled as “other”.</p>

  <p>In contrast, the dynamic scenario of the seat projection assigns each “other” party to the parliamentary group to which it is politically closest. In addition, the dynamic scenario also takes into account likely future group changes of parties that are already represented in the Parliament. In the table, the changes from the baseline to the dynamic scenario are indicated by coloured text and in the mouse-over text.</p>

  <p>The mouse-over text also lists any alternative groups that the party in question might plausibly join.</p>

  <p>In the absence of pan-European election polls, the projection is based on an aggregation of national polls and election results from all member states. The specific data basis for each country is explained in the small print below the table. For more information on European parties and political groups in the European Parliament, click here.</p>
